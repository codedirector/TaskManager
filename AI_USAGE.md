# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed as part of an internship assignment.
AI tools (ChatGPT) were used **only for non-production tasks  ** and some tools I don't have knowledge previously like Redux and IndexedDb though after watching some tutorials of redux and IndexedDb I have tried to write most of the logic but unable to sync thats I have refractored my code with the help of AI tool due to time constraints  :

âœ… Allowed Usage:

* Brainstorming folder structure & architecture.
* Generating documentation drafts (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md).
* Breaking down tasks into day-wise schedules.

All production code in this repository was written and verified manually by the author.
